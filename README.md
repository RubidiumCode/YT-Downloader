# YT-Downloader
A wrapper for the pytube-library, with a GUI script

download.py has the wrapper functions (if that is all you want)
main.py is the GUI script using tkinter to make easier use of the download.py functions

# Functions
This script can download videos in any resoloution, and get the video's subtitles, thumbnail, and any other additional information.
It can also download only the audio of the video, and a playlist, although it may fail as it gets detected as a bot.

# Download
There are some compiled exe files for use, one with the console and one without. to setup, you will have to download ffmpeg from here[https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z].
Extract the "ffmpeg" file from the zip and put it into your C: drive, and then run this command:
``
The exe should now run, but the GUI will look awful, but that will be improved upon in later versions
